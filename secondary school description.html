    <h1>Yos Sudarso High School</h1>

    <h3><i>About Yos Sudarso</i></h3>
    <p> I attended Yos Sudarso for high school, a national school where the local language is used instead of English.The school is fairly large, with a diverse student body that includes students from all income levels.
    </p><h3><i>Strengths and Challenges</i></h3><p>
        Although the classrooms lack air conditioning, Yos Sudarso is known for its strong education system and has become one of the most respected schools in my hometown.</p>
