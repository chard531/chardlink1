    <h1>self-description</h1>

   
    <p> My name is Richard Thamrin. I was born in Jakarta but raised on Batam Island, a strategically located small island near Singapore and Malaysia. I attended Yos Sudarso for both elementary and high school, where I appreciated the diverse student body and the school's strong education system. I'm trying to be adaptive and open-minded, so i can be ready to find creative solutions to overcome them. </p>
